# Project Title

Generate PDF invoice for clients for Youa Photography LLC. Pre-fills the form for existing clients. Currently uses PhantomJS, which is not supported anymore. Need to use Puppeteer, or React PDF, in future.

## Getting Started

cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd ../

## Built With

* [REACT](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/)
* [PhantomJS](https://maven.apache.org/) 


## Acknowledgments
